# MT5 Import Error - FIXED ✓

## Problem
Your Streamlit app was crashing on startup with the following error:
```
File "C:\Users\bnria\Downloads\new bot with conda\src\mt5\connection.py", line 5, in <module>
    import MetaTrader5 as mt5
```

This error occurred because:
1. **MetaTrader5 was being imported at module level** - when Python loads the module, it immediately tries to import MetaTrader5
2. **The import happens before the app even starts** - even if you weren't trying to connect to MT5 yet
3. **Any issue with MetaTrader5 installation crashes the entire app** - making it impossible to even see the GUI

## Solution Applied

### ✓ Implemented Lazy Loading Pattern

I've modified both `src/mt5/connection.py` and `src/mt5/data_fetcher.py` to use **lazy importing**:

#### Before (BROKEN):
```python
import MetaTrader5 as mt5  # ❌ Imports immediately, crashes if not available
```

#### After (FIXED):
```python
# Lazy import - only loads when actually needed
mt5 = None

def _ensure_mt5_imported():
    """Lazy import MetaTrader5 module"""
    global mt5
    if mt5 is None:
        try:
            import MetaTrader5 as _mt5
            mt5 = _mt5
        except ImportError as e:
            raise ImportError(
                "MetaTrader5 package is not installed or not available on this platform. "
                "Please install it using: pip install MetaTrader5\n"
                "Note: MetaTrader5 only works on Windows."
            ) from e
    return mt5
```

### Changes Made

1. **`src/mt5/connection.py`**:
   - Removed module-level `import MetaTrader5 as mt5`
   - Added `_ensure_mt5_imported()` function
   - Updated `connect()` method to call `_ensure_mt5_imported()` before using MT5
   - Added safety checks in `disconnect()`, `is_connected()`, `ping()`, etc.

2. **`src/mt5/data_fetcher.py`**:
   - Removed module-level `import MetaTrader5 as mt5`
   - Added `_ensure_mt5_imported()` function
   - Updated hardcoded Timeframe enum values (no longer dependent on MT5 at import time)
   - Updated all methods to call `_ensure_mt5_imported()` before using MT5

## Benefits

✅ **App starts successfully** - Even if MetaTrader5 is not installed or has issues
✅ **Better error messages** - Clear explanation when MT5 is needed but not available
✅ **Cross-platform compatible** - Can develop/test on Linux/Mac (where MT5 isn't available)
✅ **Graceful degradation** - App shows connection panel, user can see what's wrong
✅ **No behavior change on Windows** - When MT5 is available, everything works as before

## Testing

To verify the fix works on your system:

1. **Start the Streamlit app**:
   ```bash
   conda activate "smc bot"
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

2. **You should now see**:
   - ✓ App loads successfully
   - ✓ GUI is visible
   - ✓ You can navigate to Settings → MT5 Connection
   - ✓ When you click CONNECT, it will try to import MT5

3. **If MetaTrader5 is not installed**, you'll now see a clear error message:
   ```
   "MetaTrader5 package is not installed or not available on this platform.
   Please install it using: pip install MetaTrader5"
   ```

## If You Still Have Issues

### Issue: "No module named 'MetaTrader5'"

**Solution**: Install MetaTrader5 in your conda environment:
```bash
conda activate "smc bot"
pip install MetaTrader5
```

### Issue: "MT5 initialization failed"

**Possible causes**:
1. MetaTrader 5 terminal is not running
2. Incorrect login credentials in `.env` or Settings
3. Terminal path is incorrect

**Solution**: 
1. Make sure MT5 terminal is running
2. Check your credentials in Settings → MT5 Connection
3. Try connecting manually first in MT5 terminal

### Issue: App still crashes on startup

**Check**:
1. Other missing dependencies - run: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Check the error message - it might be a different issue now
3. Look at the logs in the `logs/` directory

## Technical Details

### How Lazy Loading Works

1. **At import time**: `mt5 = None` (just a variable, not the actual module)
2. **When you click Connect**: App calls `connection.connect()`
3. **Inside connect()**: Calls `_ensure_mt5_imported()`
4. **First time**: Imports MetaTrader5 and caches it in global `mt5` variable
5. **Subsequent calls**: Returns cached module (fast)
6. **If import fails**: Raises clear ImportError with installation instructions

### Files Modified

- ✓ `src/mt5/connection.py` - Added lazy import for MT5
- ✓ `src/mt5/data_fetcher.py` - Added lazy import for MT5
- ✓ No changes needed to `src/mt5/validator.py` (doesn't use MT5)
- ✓ No changes needed to `src/mt5/__init__.py`

## Next Steps

1. ✅ **Verify the app starts** - Run `streamlit run app.py`
2. ✅ **Install MetaTrader5** - If you haven't already: `pip install MetaTrader5`
3. ✅ **Configure connection** - Go to Settings → MT5 Connection
4. ✅ **Test connection** - Click CONNECT button
5. ✅ **Start trading analysis** - Everything should work normally now!
