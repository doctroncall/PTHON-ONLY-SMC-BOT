# Loguru Module Not Found - Fix Guide

## Problem
You're getting this error when starting the bot:
```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'loguru'
```

## Root Cause
The `loguru` logging library is not installed in your Anaconda environment, even though it's listed in the dependency files.

## Solution

### Option 1: Quick Fix (Recommended)
Run the quick fix script that will install loguru automatically:

```batch
fix_loguru.bat
```

This script will:
1. Check if conda is available
2. Install loguru in your current environment
3. Verify the installation

### Option 2: Manual Installation

#### Step 1: Activate your conda environment
```batch
conda activate smc_bot
```

#### Step 2: Install loguru
```batch
conda install -c conda-forge loguru -y
```

Or with pip:
```batch
pip install loguru
```

#### Step 3: Verify installation
```batch
python -c "import loguru; print(loguru.__version__)"
```

You should see a version number like `0.7.0` or similar.

### Option 3: Reinstall Environment
If the quick fix doesn't work, you may need to recreate your conda environment:

```batch
# Remove the old environment
conda env remove -n smc_bot

# Create a fresh environment
conda env create -f environment.yml

# Activate it
conda activate smc_bot

# Start the bot
conda smc.bat
```

## Prevention
The startup scripts have been updated to automatically check for loguru and install it if missing. Future runs of `conda smc.bat` or `start_bot.bat` will verify loguru is installed.

## What is Loguru?
Loguru is a Python logging library that provides:
- Better error messages and stack traces
- Automatic log file rotation
- Colored console output
- Structured logging for debugging

It's essential for the bot's monitoring and debugging capabilities.

## Still Having Issues?

### Check if you're in the right environment:
```batch
conda env list
```

Look for `smc_bot` in the list and make sure it's activated (marked with `*`).

### Check Python path:
```batch
python -c "import sys; print(sys.executable)"
```

This should point to your conda environment, not the system Python.

### Check all dependencies:
```batch
conda env update -f environment.yml -n smc_bot
```

This will update all packages to match the environment.yml file.

## Next Steps
After fixing loguru, run the bot with:
```batch
conda smc.bat
```

The bot will now start successfully!
