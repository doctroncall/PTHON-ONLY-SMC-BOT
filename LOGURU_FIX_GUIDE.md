# Loguru Module Not Found - Fix Guide

## Problem
You're getting this error when starting the bot:
```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'loguru'
```

## Root Cause
The `loguru` logging library is not installed in your Python virtual environment, even though it's listed in the dependency files.

## Solution

### Option 1: Quick Fix (Recommended)
Run the quick fix script that will install loguru automatically:

```batch
fix_loguru.bat
```

This script will:
1. Check if virtual environment exists
2. Install/upgrade loguru via pip
3. Verify the installation

### Option 2: Manual Installation

#### Step 1: Activate your virtual environment

Windows:
```batch
venv\Scripts\activate
```

Linux/Mac:
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

#### Step 2: Install loguru
```batch
pip install --upgrade loguru
```

#### Step 3: Verify installation
```batch
python -c "import loguru; print(loguru.__version__)"
```

You should see a version number like `0.7.0` or similar.

### Option 3: Reinstall Environment
If the quick fix doesn't work, you may need to recreate your virtual environment:

```batch
# Windows - Delete the old environment
rmdir /s /q venv

# Linux/Mac - Delete the old environment  
rm -rf venv

# Recreate environment by running the launcher
start_bot.bat  # Windows
./start_bot.sh  # Linux/Mac
```

## Prevention
The startup scripts have been updated to automatically check for loguru and install it if missing. Future runs of `start_bot.bat` or `./start_bot.sh` will verify loguru is installed.

## What is Loguru?
Loguru is a Python logging library that provides:
- Better error messages and stack traces
- Automatic log file rotation
- Colored console output
- Structured logging for debugging

It's essential for the bot's monitoring and debugging capabilities.

## Still Having Issues?

### Check if you're in the right environment:
```batch
# Windows
echo %VIRTUAL_ENV%

# Linux/Mac
echo $VIRTUAL_ENV
```

This should show the path to your `venv` folder.

### Check Python path:
```batch
python -c "import sys; print(sys.executable)"
```

This should point to your venv folder, not the system Python.

### Check all dependencies:
```batch
pip install -r requirements.txt --upgrade
```

This will update all packages to match the requirements.txt file.

## Next Steps
After fixing loguru, run the bot with:
```batch
# Windows
start_bot.bat

# Linux/Mac
./start_bot.sh
```

The bot will now start successfully!
